# Amiga 2000 Graphics Card (Zorro II)

This repository contains my Kicad schematics and Xilinx ISE/Verilog files for my graphics card project. This is a work in progress, started in October 2015. The first 4 prototypes were assembled in Jan/Feb 2016 and had noise problems, so I started a redesign on Feb 13, 2016.

Contains a copy of "PapPro-sdram_verilog_v0.1" by Mike Field.
